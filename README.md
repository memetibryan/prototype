# Hair Salon
The sole purpose of this project was to:
Create an application for a hair salon. The stylists at the salon work independently, so each client will only belong to a single stylist (one stylist, many clients).

The following user stories should be completed:

    1.As a salon owner, I want to view, add, update and delete stylists.
    2.As a salon owner, I want to view, add, update and delete clients.
    3.As a salon owner, I want to add clients to a stylist.
